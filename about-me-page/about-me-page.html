            <p>I am interested in pursuing a career in web design and web development 
                I am proficient in CSS, HTML, Python, and Java. I have learned about 
                Python for two years in 9th-10th grade. I have also learned Java for 7 
                months in 11th grade. In regards to CSS and HTML I have only started 
                learning about them for a few weeks in my mock internship for Maxx 
                Potential. </p>

                Writing</em></p>
            <p>I enjoy doodling and drawing on my drawing tablet in my free time. I also 
                enjoy listening to music and playing music. For example, I frequently 
                play Osu! and also play the guitar. I am fond of going to new places and 
                taking photos; whether it be inanimate objects, nature, or people. I’ve 
                always loved reading and writing in my free time. It’s a great way to 
                learn new things or to simply be entertained.</p>
